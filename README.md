# timelog
node / cli-based "working time" timer


This is a silly little script that records a minute-by minute log of if my computer is open and running.

I use it with the assumption that if I'm working on my computer then it is on, and if I'm not, then I have closed it.

This is to log how much I work during the day to give me feedback on effort vs output.
