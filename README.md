node / cli-based "working time" timer


**This is a silly little script that records a minute-by minute log of when my computer is open and running.**

I use it with the assumption that if I'm working on my computer then it is on, and if I'm not, then I have closed it.

This is to log how much I work during the day to give me feedback on effort vs output.

As simple as can be. It saves data to a json file, and it doesn't have any polish. But it does work ;)
